-Mini Project consisted mainly of a simple menu to manage adding listing and removing different object.

-University class contains different arrayLists of all the classes made.

-Project finished a while back so Idon't remember whether I implemented error handling mechanisms or not.

-Loops to keep the menu popping waiting for user input.

-Not that complicated so not much of a documentation.
